## CSS concepts for modern web-frontend development
There are more than hundreds of CSS properties available on the web. Remembering each of them is a very tedious and time consuming part, but the good part is that we don't need to remember all of them. Years ago, browsers were developed to make every web stuff accessible. So, everytime we need to use css properties we'll do nothing but a Google/Mozilla/Brave/Bing, the search you prefer and that's what people sitting at FAANG (facebook,apple, amazon, netflix, google) like companies. So, not to worry much, just learn how to implement things, how and when to use them.

### concepts to be covered in CSS
* Intro to CSS
* CSS selectors
* CSS box model
* CSS variables

While covering all above concepts we'll also deal with various CSS properties which we gonna add to our html component to give it a little smarter look by adding each of the components listed [here](https://parthpandyappp.github.io). After learning some of them later when you need other css properties to use, you're just a web-search away! Phew ε-(´・｀) ﾌ

### Hexadecimal Colors
* Hexadecimal colors are supported in all browsers.
* A hexadecimal color is specified with: `#RRGGBB`.
* `RR` (red), `GG` (green) and `BB` (blue) are hexadecimal integers between `00` and `FF` specifying the intensity of the color.
* For example, `#0000FF` is displayed as blue, because the blue component is set to its highest value `FF` and the others are set to `00`.
