## All about javaScript
Today, we're going to cover the vanillaJs basics not just thoertically but doing some actual hands-on practice. Yes, you heard it right! We're actually going to develop some Html, Css, Js web-apps which will play an important role in your javaScript learning.

### What actually we're going to do?
While learning javaScript, we're going to cover most of it's implementations by doing and not just talking about them. We're doing to design and implement javaScript to three web-apps and taht'll cover most of the basics of Vanilla Javascript.

Here's a checklist of actually what we'll be into when the session starts :

* [Counter](https://n8pii.csb.app/)
  * `onClick` event
  * javaScript variables
  * javaScript functions
  * styling using javascipt
 
<br />

* [Count-down](https://1ih4b.csb.app/) 
  * `querySelector()`
  * javaScript functions
  * javaScript conditionals
  * `setInterval`
  * `clearInterval`
 
<br /> 

* [Color Flipper](https://josji.csb.app/)
  * javaScript variables
  * defining functions in javaScript
  * `querySelector()`
  * some pre-defined javascript functions
  * styling using javascipt
  * for loop in vanilla javascript
  
### What stuff can javaScript do?
* JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
* JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
* JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
* JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
* JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes

### assignment
Using all above things, you'll be able to develop `bananaProcessor` as a web-application, which translates English to Minionese -a language which Minions use to speak. You've to use [this](https://api.funtranslations.com/translate/minion.json) API and read about `fetch` from this [MDN doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) to further use this API.

If you find any trouble doing it, jump off to the source code I developed [here](https://github.com/parthpandyappp/BananaProcessor)
